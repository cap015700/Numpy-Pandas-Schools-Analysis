Analyze the district-wide standardized test results given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance. 

Final report should includes each of the following:

**District Summary**
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**School Summary**
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**

  * Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate that includes all of the same metrics as above.

**Math Scores by Grade**

  * Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Reading Scores by Grade**

  * Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Scores by School Spending**
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Scores by School Size**

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

**Scores by School Type**

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

**Final considerations:**

* Script must work for both data-sets given.
* Use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.   

**Observable trends based on the data**
  * Observable Trend 1 - Based on Overall Passing Rate, the top performing schools were small to medium sized charter schools.
  * Observable Trend 2 - Based on Overall Passing Rate, the bottom performing schools were large, district schools.
  * Observable Trend 3 - Math and Reading Scores by Grade showed no significant variance or trends.
